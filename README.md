Definition Dash is the project I did for my A Level Computer Science coursework (OCR Component 3).

I will soon be providing:
- more details about what the project is
- my coursework document (filtered to not include anything about my school)
- a sample map
- sample questions
After which I will be working on making a publicly accessible version of the game for everyone to try out!
