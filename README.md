Definition Dash is the project I did for my A Level Computer Science coursework (OCR Component 3).

If you're curious to see my coursework document, you can find it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TZDMiR4YFmcoBMSbNe27Hw3MF8uMsO2e?usp=drive_link).
I used my actual college's map to test the project while I was working on it for the coursework so, to protect my privacy, some parts of the document have had to be redacted.

If you would like to test the project yourself, I have produced a new sample map (not based on any existing map) in the `sample-data` folder.
You can follow the same usage instructions provided in the document and corresponding videos.

Once I have produced the terms of use and privacy policy, I will also host a publicly accessible version of the project.
